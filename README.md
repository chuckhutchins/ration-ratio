# ration//ratio

Deployed on [Netlify](https://ration-ratio.netlify.app/)

A small utility to quickly generate nutritional values for a single serving based on total values (calories, fat, carbs, and protein) for the entire recipe. Can also work in reverse if you want to extrapolate an individual serving into the total amount you actually took.

This utility is only in grams since it is the best and most accurate way to calculate this stuff, but I suppose as long as you're consistent with the grams fields between the two columns, it should work fine (ounces to ounces, dust to dust).
